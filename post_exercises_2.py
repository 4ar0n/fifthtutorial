Q2.1
write a function to which take input of a list of list which contains 2 number in every two lists, and output a list with 3 number, the third being the product of the first two:
input:[[3,4],[5,6],[8,9]]
output:[[3,4,12],[5,6,30],[8,9,72]]



write a function to which take input of a list of list which contains 2 number in every two lists, and output a list with 3 number, the third being the product of the first two:
input:[[3,4],[5,6],[8,9]]
output:[[3,4,12],[5,6,30],[8,9,72]]


Q2.2
write a fucntion to take two lists as input:

multiple  the two lists to give the product.
input1:[2,4,6,8,10]
input2:[10,20,30,40,50]
output:[20,80,180,320,500]
[12:32 PM, 12/6/2020] a4r0n: write a function which takes a list of number:
[12,13,24,15,45,56,33,46,90,34,55,66,33,54,66,33,45,22,43,67]

with the output of a dictionary:
{10:x,20:x,30:x,40:x,50:x,60:x,70:x,80:x,90:x,100:x}

x is the number of occurrence of the list if its smaller then the number
i.e. 100:20

Q2.3
Build a dictionary for further use so that when Mark_DB[student_name][subject_name] is called, the mark is returned.
student_list = ["Jason","Ka","Aaron","Vincent","Billy"]
Marks = {"English":0,"Mathematics":0,"Chinese":0,"LS":0,"GEOG":0,"BAFS":0,"PHYSICS":0,"M1":0,"M2":0,"CHEM":0,"BIO":0}

now make Jason's Eng mark to be 95 and Aaron's BAFS mark to 38. pprint the results
